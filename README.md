<h1 align="center">Xiler Temporary Bot</h1>

<!-- Description -->
The temporary bot for the Xiler discord.  
This bot manages:
* auto roles
* suggestions channel 

![Example Log](https://brain.is-inside.me/kIuGQkhG.png)

## Setting it up:
###### ! THIS WASN'T MADE WITH THE INTENTIONS OF EASY SELF HOSTING !
Running the bot is easy, and pretty much only has two requirements. 
One is that there has to be a `log` folder, the second one is that there 
has to be a *(valid)* provided bot token in the `config.cfg` file!

If you want to use this more for your own server, feel free to edit 
the already in-code channel/guild id's!
